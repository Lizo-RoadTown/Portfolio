# NOTION_INTERFACE_LAYER_v2.md

### *Operational + Scientific Definition of Notion as an Observation Interface*

This document defines **exactly** what Notion is, what it is not, and how agents may interact with it. It is grounded in the FRAMES theoretical ontology and designed to prevent the confusion, overreach, and unsafe behavior previously observed in agents.

This file replaces prior assumptions about Notion and serves as the canonical description of Notion’s role in the FRAMES ecosystem.

---

# 1. Purpose of This Document

Notion is one of the primary **digital observation surfaces** through which FRAMES views team behavior. Because it is human-owned and central to real work, agents must treat it with extreme care and conceptual clarity.

This document establishes:

* what Notion represents in the ontology,
* what kinds of data it contains,
* how it relates to modules and learning,
* what interactions agents are allowed to perform,
* what interactions are strictly forbidden,
* how Notion fits into the system architecture.

All agents must follow this file precisely.

---

# 2. What Notion *Is* (Scientific + Operational Definition)

Notion is a **digital interface layer** where human team members externalize work, knowledge, decisions, and interactions.

It is:

* a *human-owned workspace*,
* a *coordination platform*,
* a *memory externalization tool*,
* an *observation surface* for FRAMES,
* a *record* of tasks, reasoning, and interfaces.

Notion does **not** create the system—it merely exposes traces of the underlying human system so FRAMES can observe and interpret them.

---

# 3. What Notion *Is Not*

To prevent conceptual drift, agents must internalize the following prohibitions:

Notion is **NOT**:

* a canonical database,
* a module builder,
* a workspace for agents,
* a location for structured learning content,
* a logical schema,
* a place for agents to create synthetic data,
* an environment for system-driven restructuring.

Notion is a **sensor layer**, not a structured data layer.

---

# 4. What Lives in Notion (Allowed Observables)

Agents may use Notion to observe human behavior. Agents may extract:

* task descriptions,
* engineering reasoning,
* design decisions,
* checklists and procedures,
* comments and questions,
* cross-team interactions,
* sequence of edits and updates,
* problem-solving paths.

These traces represent the **real engineering workflow**.

Agents must treat each observable as a *signal*, not a schema.

---

# 5. Notion's Relationship to Modules

This is one of the most important clarifications.

### 5.1 Modules Do Not Live in Notion

Modules are:

* structured,
* validated,
* canonical learning artifacts,
* stored exclusively in the FRAMES database.

### 5.2 Notion Provides Source Material for Modules

Agents extract module-relevant signals from:

* task sequences,
* decision records,
* troubleshooting logs,
* subsystem interfaces,
* human journeys.

### 5.3 Agents Must Never Treat a Notion Page as a Module

A Notion page:

* may contain unstructured raw context,
* may contain rich engineering content,
* may reference a module,
* may link to a module,
* **is not itself a module**.

This boundary is absolute.

---

# 6. Agent Permissions in Notion (Strict Rules)

Notion is a human-owned workspace. Agents must follow strict rules to ensure safety, integrity, and trust.

## 6.1 Agents May **Read** Freely

Agents may:

* read any Notion content they are granted access to,
* analyze structure,
* extract reasoning,
* identify interfaces,
* identify module candidates.

Reading is **unrestricted**.

---

## 6.2 Agents May **Write Only** Inside Explicit Agent-Safe Regions

Agents may not modify human content.

Agents may:

* add structured annotations only inside designated regions,
* update system-generated links (e.g., references to modules),
* append metadata in agent-safe blocks.

Agents may not:

* overwrite content,
* modify structure,
* rearrange human sections,
* insert content outside safe regions.

---

## 6.3 Agents Must **Never** Reformat, Restructure, or Repurpose Human Pages

This includes:

* adding or removing headings,
* refactoring layouts,
* reorganizing content,
* creating or deleting pages (unless explicitly instructed),
* altering templates,
* collapsing or expanding sections.

Any such action constitutes a violation of the ontology and must not occur.

---

## 6.4 Agents Must Ask for Clarification When:

* a required safe region does not exist,
* content is ambiguous,
* the user intent is unclear,
* an operation risks damaging human content.

If in doubt, **stop and ask**.

---

# 7. Safe Interaction Procedure (Mandatory)

All agent operations involving Notion must follow this sequence:

1. **Interpretation:** Identify the task and required interaction.
2. **Boundary Check:** Ensure the action follows this file.
3. **Request Creation of Safe Region** (if needed).
4. **Write Only Inside Safe Region.**
5. **Validation:** Another agent verifies compliance.

No irreversible actions may occur without validation.

---

# 8. Conceptual Boundary Conditions

Agents must keep clear the distinction between:

### 8.1 Theoretical Layer (Scientific Ontology)

Used to interpret behavior.

### 8.2 Operational Layer (This File + Operational Ontology)

Used to constrain action.

### 8.3 Human Workspace Layer (Notion)

Must remain intact, stable, and human-owned.

Agents must **never** bring theoretical metaphors (e.g., "molecules," "topology") into operational interaction with Notion.

---

# 9. How Agents Should Think About Notion

Agents should conceptualize Notion as:

* an external memory surface,
* a human collaboration interface,
* a place where engineering reasoning becomes visible,
* a non-structured but richly contextual world,
* a source of evidence for module creation,
* a protected environment under human control.

Notion is **not** a workspace for AI creativity.
Notion is a **measurement device**.

---

# 10. Purpose of This Interface Layer Definition

This document exists to:

* protect human workspaces,
* ground agent reasoning,
* prevent dangerous or destructive actions,
* maintain conceptual clarity,
* enforce strict operational boundaries,
* support safe module extraction,
* ensure alignment with the FRAMES ontology.

Agents must reference this file when reasoning about or interacting with Notion.

No exceptions.
