# What is FRAMES?

**FRAMES** (Framework for Research & Analytics in Mission Engineering Systems) is a **multi-university research platform** developing predictive models for **organizational mission success** in complex engineering environments.

University space labs serve as the research environment—small enough to fully instrument, with clear mission outcomes and natural experiments in knowledge loss as students rotate. The insights apply far beyond education: any organization undertaking complex emergent technology missions faces the same structural risks.

## The Research Question

> **Can we predict mission success or failure based on organizational structure?**

FRAMES is building a predictive model grounded in Herbert Simon's work on near-decomposable systems. By mapping interfaces between people and subsystems, measuring bond strength, and tracking knowledge distribution, the model identifies structural vulnerabilities before they cause mission failure.

## The Real Problem: Team Leads Are Overwhelmed

In university space labs, **team leads carry an impossible burden**:

- **Constant rotation** — Students cycle in and out every semester; team leads start over constantly
- **Onboarding consumes everything** — Hours spent teaching the same basics to each new cohort
- **No time for mentorship** — Administrative burden crowds out hands-on guidance
- **Knowledge walks out the door** — Graduating students take expertise with them
- **Reinventing the wheel** — Each generation rediscovers what predecessors already solved

Team leads want to connect with students, guide projects, and share hard-won expertise. Instead, they're buried in repetitive onboarding, documentation, and process management.

---

## What FRAMES Does for Team Leads

FRAMES exists to **give team leads their time back**:

- **Automated onboarding** — The model handles routine training; team leads handle the human stuff
- **Auto-generated SOPs** — Drop your notes, get lab procedures; no manual documentation grind
- **Smart module recommendations** — Students get the right content at the right time, automatically
- **Knowledge preservation** — Expertise stays in the system when students graduate
- **Workflow automation** — Less administrative overhead, more mentorship time

**The goal:** As the model learns from real outcomes, it gets better at taking documentation burden off team leads—so they can focus on what only humans can do: connect with students and provide hands-on guidance.

## The Predictive Model: From Theory to Application

FRAMES is operationalizing Herbert Simon's research on complex organizations into a **predictive model for mission success**.

### The Molecular Model of Organizations

```
ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE
   Nodes = People holding localized knowledge
   Bonds = Interfaces (communication, handoffs, dependencies)
   Bond Strength = Frequency, reciprocity, error recovery
   Subsystems = Functional clusters with strong internal bonds
```

When someone leaves an organization, they don't just remove knowledge—they **break bonds**. The model predicts which bond breaks will cause structural failure.

### What the Model Predicts

| Risk Factor | Prediction |
|-------------|------------|
| **Interface fragility** | Which connections between subsystems will fail under stress |
| **Knowledge concentration** | Single points of failure where expertise is too centralized |
| **Transition risk** | What breaks when key people leave |
| **Subsystem isolation** | Which teams aren't communicating enough |
| **Mission success probability** | Overall likelihood given current structure |

### Why University Space Labs?

They're the ideal research environment:

- **Small enough to fully instrument** — Track every interface, every handoff
- **Clear outcomes** — Missions succeed or fail; no ambiguity
- **Natural experiments** — Student rotation creates controlled knowledge loss events
- **High stakes** — Real satellites, real consequences

### Broader Implications

If the model works here, it applies to:

- NASA and commercial space programs
- Startup engineering teams
- R&D laboratories
- Any organization undertaking complex emergent technology missions

## Theoretical Foundations

FRAMES is built on established research:

1. **Nearly Decomposable Architecture** (Herbert Simon) — Models semi-independent organizational modules
2. **Hybrid Autonomous Organizations** (Champenois & Etzkowitz) — University space labs in boundary spaces
3. **OATutor Pedagogy** — Scaffolding, hint pathways, validation steps
4. **Knowledge Transfer Research** — Codified vs tacit knowledge tracking
