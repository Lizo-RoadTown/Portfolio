# What is FRAMES?

**FRAMES** (Framework for Research & Analytics in Mission Engineering Systems) is a **multi-university research platform** designed to transform how university engineering teams—especially those in CubeSat and aerospace programs—learn, collaborate, and transfer knowledge.

FRAMES captures how students and teams **actually think, collaborate, and solve problems** in university space labs, then transforms those practices into actionable resources.

## The Real Problem: Team Leads Are Overwhelmed

In university space labs, **team leads carry an impossible burden**:

- **Constant rotation** — Students cycle in and out every semester; team leads start over constantly
- **Onboarding consumes everything** — Hours spent teaching the same basics to each new cohort
- **No time for mentorship** — Administrative burden crowds out hands-on guidance
- **Knowledge walks out the door** — Graduating students take expertise with them
- **Reinventing the wheel** — Each generation rediscovers what predecessors already solved

Team leads want to connect with students, guide projects, and share hard-won expertise. Instead, they're buried in repetitive onboarding, documentation, and process management.

---

## What FRAMES Does for Team Leads

FRAMES exists to **give team leads their time back**:

- **Automated onboarding** — The model handles routine training; team leads handle the human stuff
- **Auto-generated SOPs** — Drop your notes, get lab procedures; no manual documentation grind
- **Smart module recommendations** — Students get the right content at the right time, automatically
- **Knowledge preservation** — Expertise stays in the system when students graduate
- **Workflow automation** — Less administrative overhead, more mentorship time

**The goal:** As the model learns from real outcomes, it gets better at taking documentation burden off team leads—so they can focus on what only humans can do: connect with students and provide hands-on guidance.

## The Core Innovation: A Space Lab Predictive Model

At the heart of FRAMES is a **predictive model trained on organizational risk factors** derived from Herbert Simon's research on complex systems. This isn't a chatbot or a learning recommendation engine—it's a system that predicts **mission success based on where knowledge is vulnerable**.

### How It Works

```
REAL WORLD
   Teams work, students rotate in/out, interfaces form and break
                              ↓
THREE AGENTS (Interpreter · Builder · Validator)
   Map interfaces, measure bond strength, identify risk factors
                              ↓
SPACE LAB PREDICTIVE MODEL
   Trained on Simon's molecular model of organizational structure
                              ↓
RISK PREDICTIONS
   "Interface between power and comms is weak—single point of failure"
   "Knowledge concentration risk: 80% of avionics expertise in one student"
   "Graduation risk: 3 critical interfaces lost next semester"
```

### What the Model Actually Predicts

| Risk Factor | What It Tells You |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **Interface strength** | Which connections between subsystems are fragile |
| **Knowledge concentration** | Where expertise is dangerously centralized |
| **Graduation risk** | Which interfaces will break when students leave |
| **Subsystem isolation** | Which teams aren't communicating enough |
| **Mission success probability** | Overall likelihood of project completion |

The three agents don't make predictions—they map the organizational structure. The model learns which structural patterns lead to mission success or failure.

## Theoretical Foundations

FRAMES is built on established research:

1. **Nearly Decomposable Architecture** (Herbert Simon) — Models semi-independent organizational modules
2. **Hybrid Autonomous Organizations** (Champenois & Etzkowitz) — University space labs in boundary spaces
3. **OATutor Pedagogy** — Scaffolding, hint pathways, validation steps
4. **Knowledge Transfer Research** — Codified vs tacit knowledge tracking
