# Framework for Research & Analytics in Mission Engineering Systems

**FRAMES** is a multi-university research platform developing **predictive models for organizational mission success** in complex engineering environments.

---

## The Research Question

> **Can we predict mission success or failure based on organizational structure?**

University space programs train the next generation of aerospace engineers while delivering real NASA-contracted missions. Yet structural challenges—student rotation, knowledge handoffs, team interface maintenance—limit documented success rates to 12-15%.

These programs provide an ideal research environment: real stakes, fully observable structure, clear success metrics. Insights developed here apply directly to NASA centers, commercial space companies, startups, and R&D organizations facing similar knowledge continuity challenges.

## What FRAMES Does

    subgraph FRAMES["FRAMES PLATFORM"]
        A["Map organizational<br/>structure"]
        B["Identify structural<br/>vulnerabilities"]
        C["Predict mission<br/>risk"]
        D["Guide<br/>interventions"]
    end

```

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Organizational Mapping** | Instrument team structure—interfaces, bond strength, knowledge distribution |
| **Risk Prediction** | Identify vulnerabilities before they cause failure |
| **Knowledge Continuity** | Track where expertise lives and what breaks when people leave |
| **Intervention Design** | Evidence-based recommendations for reinforcing weak interfaces |

## What the Model Predicts

| Risk Factor | Prediction |
|-------------|------------|
| **Interface fragility** | Which connections between subsystems will fail under stress |
| **Knowledge concentration** | Single points of failure where expertise is too centralized |
| **Transition risk** | What breaks when key people leave |
| **Subsystem isolation** | Which teams aren't communicating enough |
| **Mission success probability** | Overall likelihood given current structure |

## Why University Space Labs?

University CubeSat programs are the ideal research environment:

- **Real stakes** — NASA-contracted missions with actual deliverables
- **Observable structure** — Teams small enough to fully instrument
- **Clear outcomes** — Missions succeed or fail; no ambiguity  
- **Natural experiments** — Student rotation creates controlled knowledge loss events

The insights developed here apply directly to NASA centers, commercial space companies, R&D labs, and any organization undertaking complex emergent technology missions.
