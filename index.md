# What is FRAMES?

**FRAMES** (Framework for Research & Analytics in Mission Engineering Systems) is a **multi-university research platform** designed to transform how university engineering teams—especially those in CubeSat and aerospace programs—learn, collaborate, and transfer knowledge.

FRAMES captures how students and teams **actually think, collaborate, and solve problems** in university space labs, then transforms those practices into actionable resources.

## The Challenge

University engineering programs face persistent challenges:

- **Uneven Preparation** — Students arrive with vastly different skill levels
- **Knowledge Loss** — Critical expertise disappears every semester with graduating students
- **Steep Learning Curves** — New team members take too long to become productive
- **Fragile Continuity** — Programs struggle to maintain momentum across cohorts
- **Process Reinvention** — Teams constantly rediscover solutions their predecessors already found

---

## What FRAMES Enables

With FRAMES, university programs can:

- **Retain Knowledge** — Capture and preserve expertise across student generations
- **Coordinate Effectively** — Connect distributed teams with shared understanding
- **Accelerate Onboarding** — Get new members productive faster
- **Identify Vulnerabilities** — Understand where systems and knowledge are fragile
- **Generate Research Data** — Produce datasets for studying team dynamics and learning

## The Core Innovation: A Space Lab Predictive Model

At the heart of FRAMES is a **custom predictive model trained on real student outcomes** from university space lab programs. This isn't a generic AI—it's a specialized system that learns what actually works in engineering education.

### How It Works

```
REAL WORLD
   Students complete modules, teams make decisions, projects succeed or fail
                              ↓
THREE AGENTS (Interpreter · Builder · Validator)
   Structure observations into training data
                              ↓
SPACE LAB PREDICTIVE MODEL
   Learns from outcomes: Who succeeded? What paths worked? Which content helped?
                              ↓
PREDICTIONS THAT MATTER
   "This student needs Module 7 next"
   "This learning path has 84% success rate for similar students"
   "This module isn't working—here's why"
```

### Why Build Our Own Model?

| External LLM APIs | Space Lab Predictive Model |
|-------------------|----------------------------|
| Generic knowledge | Trained on *your* students, *your* outcomes |
| Per-call costs | Runs locally, no API fees |
| Black box reasoning | Explainable predictions tied to real data |
| One-size-fits-all | Optimized for aerospace engineering education |

The three agents don't make decisions—they feed the model. The model learns what works. The applications serve predictions back to students, team leads, and researchers.

## Theoretical Foundations

FRAMES is built on established research:

1. **Nearly Decomposable Architecture** (Herbert Simon) — Models semi-independent organizational modules
2. **Hybrid Autonomous Organizations** (Champenois & Etzkowitz) — University space labs in boundary spaces
3. **OATutor Pedagogy** — Scaffolding, hint pathways, validation steps
4. **Knowledge Transfer Research** — Codified vs tacit knowledge tracking
