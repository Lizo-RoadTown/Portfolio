# About the FRAMES Project

**FRAMES** (Framework for Research & Analytics in Mission Engineering Systems) is a comprehensive research-driven ecosystem that transforms real engineering work—especially in university CubeSat and aerospace programs—into structured learning, organizational insight, and research-grade data.

---

## Our Mission

FRAMES exists to solve a fundamental challenge in university engineering education: **knowledge continuity**.

Every semester, university engineering programs face the same problems:

- Graduating students take critical expertise with them
- New students struggle with steep learning curves  
- Teams repeatedly solve problems that predecessors already solved
- Institutional memory fragments across cohort transitions

**FRAMES addresses these challenges** by creating a persistent system that captures, organizes, and distributes knowledge across time and across teams.

## Theoretical Foundations

FRAMES is grounded in Herbert Simon's work on complex systems and organizational behavior. This isn't just academic framing—it directly shapes how the system works.

### How Knowledge Actually Lives in Teams

Simon's research revealed that complex organizations self-organize into **near-decomposable systems**:

- **Strong bonds within subsystems** — The power team talks constantly; they know each other's work intimately
- **Weak bonds between subsystems** — Power and comms teams interact at defined interfaces, not continuously
- **Knowledge lives in the bonds** — Expertise isn't just in people's heads; it's in *how people work together*

### Why Knowledge Walks Out the Door

When a student graduates, they don't just take their individual knowledge—they take their **interfaces**:

| What's Lost | Why It Matters |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Communication patterns** | Who to ask about what |
| **Handoff protocols** | How work flows between subsystems |
| **Error recovery knowledge** | What to do when things break |
| **Dependency awareness** | What affects what |

The next cohort doesn't just need to learn the technical content—they need to *rebuild the interfaces* that made the team functional. This is why onboarding feels like starting over every semester.

### What FRAMES Captures

FRAMES treats team behavior as a measurable system:

- **Interfaces** — Connections between people/subsystems measured by frequency, reciprocity, bandwidth, error recovery
- **Journeys** — The sequence of tasks a student performs over time (what they touched, who they worked with, where they struggled)
- **Digital surfaces** — Notion, GitHub, Slack as observation layers that reveal behavior without distorting it
- **Modules** — Structured learning artifacts *extracted from* real engineering work, not invented

### The Research Basis

- **Simon, H. A. (1962)** — *The Architecture of Complexity* — Near-decomposable systems
- **Simon, H. A. (1969)** — *The Sciences of the Artificial* — Bounded rationality, satisficing
- **Simon, H. A. (1991)** — *Bounded Rationality and Organizational Learning*
- **Champenois & Etzkowitz** — Hybrid Autonomous Organizations (university space labs as boundary spaces)
- **OATutor Research** — Scaffolding, hint pathways, validation steps

## AI Philosophy: Agents Feed the Model, Humans Stay in Control

FRAMES uses three specialized agents (Interpreter, Builder, Validator), but they don't make decisions—they structure observations into training data for the Space Lab Predictive Model.

### What Agents Do

- **Interpreter** — Reads digital traces, identifies decisions and dependencies
- **Builder** — Structures observations into module candidates and feature vectors
- **Validator** — Checks consistency, flags issues, ensures FERPA compliance

### What the Model Does

The Space Lab Predictive Model learns from real student outcomes:

- Which learning paths led to success
- Where students struggled
- What content actually helped
- Which interfaces are weak or strong

### Human-First Principles

Agents and model operate under strict constraints:

- **Risk-based autonomy** — Low-risk actions proceed; high-risk actions require human approval
- **No invention** — Modules are *extracted* from real work, never fabricated
- **Surfaces are sacred** — Agents observe Notion; they don't restructure it
- **Full audit trail** — Every agent action logged for research and accountability

The goal: automate the repetitive burden so team leads can focus on what only humans can do—connect with students, guide projects, share hard-won expertise.

## Research Outputs

FRAMES generates valuable research artifacts:

- **Collaboration Datasets** — Anonymized patterns of team interaction
- **Learning Analytics** — Module completion, hint usage, assessment results
- **Process Documentation** — How teams actually work (vs. how they plan to work)
- **Longitudinal Studies** — Knowledge transfer across semesters and cohorts
