# About the FRAMES Project

**FRAMES** (Framework for Research & Analytics in Mission Engineering Systems) is a comprehensive research-driven ecosystem that transforms real engineering work—especially in university CubeSat and aerospace programs—into structured learning, organizational insight, and research-grade data.

## 🎯 Our Mission

FRAMES exists to solve a fundamental challenge in university engineering education: **knowledge continuity**.

Every semester, university engineering programs face the same problems:
- Graduating students take critical expertise with them
- New students struggle with steep learning curves  
- Teams repeatedly solve problems that predecessors already solved
- Institutional memory fragments across cohort transitions

**FRAMES addresses these challenges** by creating a persistent system that captures, organizes, and distributes knowledge across time and across teams.

## 🔬 Theoretical Foundations

FRAMES is built on established research from multiple disciplines:

### 1. Nearly Decomposable Architecture (Herbert Simon)
Simon's theory of hierarchical systems provides the foundation for how FRAMES models semi-independent organizational modules. University engineering teams naturally organize into subsystems that interact through well-defined interfaces—FRAMES captures and supports this structure.

### 2. Hybrid Autonomous Organizations (Champenois & Etzkowitz)
University space labs occupy unique "boundary spaces" between academia, government, and industry. This theoretical lens helps FRAMES understand and support the complex stakeholder relationships in university aerospace programs.

### 3. OATutor Pedagogy
FRAMES' learning modules incorporate research-backed educational approaches:
- **Scaffolding** — Breaking complex tasks into manageable steps
- **Hint Pathways** — Progressive disclosure of supporting information
- **Validation Steps** — Confirming understanding before advancing

### 4. Knowledge Transfer & Organizational Resilience
FRAMES explicitly tracks both:
- **Codified Knowledge** — Documentation, procedures, technical specs
- **Tacit Knowledge** — Expertise, intuition, experience-based insights

This distinction helps programs understand where knowledge is secure versus vulnerable.

## 🤖 AI Philosophy: Human-First Collaboration

FRAMES incorporates AI agents (Alpha, Beta, Gamma), but with a fundamental principle: **AI assists, humans decide**.

Our agents are designed to:
- ✅ Summarize and organize information
- ✅ Flag potential issues for human review
- ✅ Generate drafts for human refinement
- ✅ Track patterns across large datasets

Our agents do **not**:
- ❌ Make autonomous decisions about student progress
- ❌ Replace human mentorship or judgment
- ❌ Access data beyond their defined scope
- ❌ Operate without human oversight

This controlled approach demonstrates responsible AI integration in educational contexts.

## 📈 Research Outputs

FRAMES generates valuable research artifacts:

- **Collaboration Datasets** — Anonymized patterns of team interaction
- **Learning Analytics** — Module completion, hint usage, assessment results
- **Process Documentation** — How teams actually work (vs. how they plan to work)
- **Longitudinal Studies** — Knowledge transfer across semesters and cohorts
