**FRAMES** (Framework for Research & Analytics in Mission Engineering Systems) is a multi-university research platform developing **predictive models for organizational mission success** in complex engineering environments.

---

## The Research Problem

Complex engineering missions fail not just because of technical problems—they fail because of **organizational structure problems**:

- Critical knowledge concentrated in too few people
- Weak interfaces between subsystems
- Expertise that walks out the door when people leave
- Communication patterns that don't match dependency patterns

FRAMES is building a predictive model, grounded in Herbert Simon's foundational work on complex systems, that can identify these structural vulnerabilities before they cause mission failure.

## Why University Space Labs?

University CubeSat programs are the ideal research environment:

| Property | Research Value |
|----------|----------------|
| **NASA contracts** | Real deliverables, real deadlines, real consequences |
| **Visible interfaces** | Small teams make every connection observable |
| **Clear outcomes** | Missions succeed or fail; no ambiguity |
| **Student rotation** | Natural experiments in knowledge loss |
| **Multi-institution** | Cross-validate across different contexts |

These aren't classroom projects—they're NASA-contracted missions with actual deliverables. The teams are small enough to fully instrument, but the work is real enough that success and failure have consequences. This combination makes university space labs uniquely valuable for organizational research.

The insights developed here apply directly to NASA centers, commercial space companies, R&D labs, and any organization undertaking complex emergent technology missions.

## Theoretical Foundations

FRAMES is grounded in Herbert Simon's work on complex systems and organizational behavior. This isn't just academic framing—it directly shapes how the system works.

### How Knowledge Actually Lives in Teams

Simon's research revealed that complex organizations self-organize into **near-decomposable systems**:

- **Strong bonds within subsystems** — The power team talks constantly; they know each other's work intimately
- **Weak bonds between subsystems** — Power and comms teams interact at defined interfaces, not continuously
- **Knowledge lives in the bonds** — Expertise isn't just in people's heads; it's in *how people work together*

### Why Knowledge Walks Out the Door

When a student graduates, they don't just take their individual knowledge—they take their **interfaces**:

| What's Lost | Why It Matters |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Communication patterns** | Who to ask about what |
| **Handoff protocols** | How work flows between subsystems |
| **Error recovery knowledge** | What to do when things break |
| **Dependency awareness** | What affects what |

The next cohort doesn't just need to learn the technical content—they need to *rebuild the interfaces* that made the team functional. This is why onboarding feels like starting over every semester.

### What FRAMES Captures

FRAMES treats team behavior as a measurable system:

- **Interfaces** — Connections between people/subsystems measured by frequency, reciprocity, bandwidth, error recovery
- **Journeys** — The sequence of tasks a student performs over time (what they touched, who they worked with, where they struggled)
- **Digital surfaces** — Notion, GitHub, Slack as observation layers that reveal behavior without distorting it
- **Modules** — Structured learning artifacts *extracted from* real engineering work, not invented

### The Research Basis

- **Simon, H. A. (1962)** — *The Architecture of Complexity* — Near-decomposable systems
- **Simon, H. A. (1969)** — *The Sciences of the Artificial* — Bounded rationality, satisficing
- **Simon, H. A. (1991)** — *Bounded Rationality and Organizational Learning*
- **Champenois & Etzkowitz** — Hybrid Autonomous Organizations (university space labs as boundary spaces)
- **OATutor Research** — Scaffolding, hint pathways, validation steps

## AI Philosophy: Agents Map Structure, Model Predicts Risk

FRAMES uses three specialized agents (Interpreter, Builder, Validator), but they don't make predictions—they map the organizational structure so the model can assess risk.

### What Agents Do

- **Interpreter** — Reads digital traces, identifies interfaces and communication patterns
- **Builder** — Constructs the organizational topology: who connects to whom, bond strengths
- **Validator** — Checks consistency, flags structural anomalies, ensures data quality

### What the Model Predicts

The Space Lab Predictive Model is trained on Simon's molecular model of organizations:

- **Interface strength** — Which connections between people/subsystems are fragile
- **Knowledge concentration** — Where expertise is dangerously centralized in one person
- **Graduation risk** — Which bonds will break when students leave
- **Mission success probability** — Overall likelihood based on current structure

### Human-First Principles

Agents and model operate under strict constraints:

- **Risk-based autonomy** — Low-risk observations proceed; high-risk flags require human review
- **No invention** — Modules are *extracted* from real work, never fabricated
- **Surfaces are sacred** — Agents observe Notion; they don't restructure it
- **Full audit trail** — Every agent action logged for research and accountability

The goal: give team leads visibility into organizational risk so they can act before knowledge walks out the door.

## Research Outputs

FRAMES generates valuable research artifacts:

- **Collaboration Datasets** — Anonymized patterns of team interaction
- **Learning Analytics** — Module completion, hint usage, assessment results
- **Process Documentation** — How teams actually work (vs. how they plan to work)
- **Longitudinal Studies** — Knowledge transfer across semesters and cohorts
