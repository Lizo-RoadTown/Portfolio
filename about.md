# About the FRAMES Project

**FRAMES** (Framework for Research & Analytics in Mission Engineering Systems) is a comprehensive research-driven ecosystem that transforms real engineering work—especially in university CubeSat and aerospace programs—into structured learning, organizational insight, and research-grade data.

---

## Our Mission

FRAMES exists to solve a fundamental challenge in university engineering education: **knowledge continuity**.

Every semester, university engineering programs face the same problems:

- Graduating students take critical expertise with them
- New students struggle with steep learning curves  
- Teams repeatedly solve problems that predecessors already solved
- Institutional memory fragments across cohort transitions

**FRAMES addresses these challenges** by creating a persistent system that captures, organizes, and distributes knowledge across time and across teams.

## Theoretical Foundations

FRAMES is grounded in Herbert Simon's work on complex systems and organizational behavior. This isn't just academic framing—it directly shapes how the system works.

### How Knowledge Actually Lives in Teams

Simon's research revealed that complex organizations self-organize into **near-decomposable systems**:

- **Strong bonds within subsystems** — The power team talks constantly; they know each other's work intimately
- **Weak bonds between subsystems** — Power and comms teams interact at defined interfaces, not continuously
- **Knowledge lives in the bonds** — Expertise isn't just in people's heads; it's in *how people work together*

### Why Knowledge Walks Out the Door

When a student graduates, they don't just take their individual knowledge—they take their **interfaces**:

| What's Lost | Why It Matters |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Communication patterns** | Who to ask about what |
| **Handoff protocols** | How work flows between subsystems |
| **Error recovery knowledge** | What to do when things break |
| **Dependency awareness** | What affects what |

The next cohort doesn't just need to learn the technical content—they need to *rebuild the interfaces* that made the team functional. This is why onboarding feels like starting over every semester.

### What FRAMES Captures

FRAMES treats team behavior as a measurable system:

- **Interfaces** — Connections between people/subsystems measured by frequency, reciprocity, bandwidth, error recovery
- **Journeys** — The sequence of tasks a student performs over time (what they touched, who they worked with, where they struggled)
- **Digital surfaces** — Notion, GitHub, Slack as observation layers that reveal behavior without distorting it
- **Modules** — Structured learning artifacts *extracted from* real engineering work, not invented

### The Research Basis

- **Simon, H. A. (1962)** — *The Architecture of Complexity* — Near-decomposable systems
- **Simon, H. A. (1969)** — *The Sciences of the Artificial* — Bounded rationality, satisficing
- **Simon, H. A. (1991)** — *Bounded Rationality and Organizational Learning*
- **Champenois & Etzkowitz** — Hybrid Autonomous Organizations (university space labs as boundary spaces)
- **OATutor Research** — Scaffolding, hint pathways, validation steps

## AI Philosophy: Agents Map Structure, Model Predicts Risk

FRAMES uses three specialized agents (Interpreter, Builder, Validator), but they don't make predictions—they map the organizational structure so the model can assess risk.

### What Agents Do

- **Interpreter** — Reads digital traces, identifies interfaces and communication patterns
- **Builder** — Constructs the organizational topology: who connects to whom, bond strengths
- **Validator** — Checks consistency, flags structural anomalies, ensures data quality

### What the Model Predicts

The Space Lab Predictive Model is trained on Simon's molecular model of organizations:

- **Interface strength** — Which connections between people/subsystems are fragile
- **Knowledge concentration** — Where expertise is dangerously centralized in one person
- **Graduation risk** — Which bonds will break when students leave
- **Mission success probability** — Overall likelihood based on current structure

### Human-First Principles

Agents and model operate under strict constraints:

- **Risk-based autonomy** — Low-risk observations proceed; high-risk flags require human review
- **No invention** — Modules are *extracted* from real work, never fabricated
- **Surfaces are sacred** — Agents observe Notion; they don't restructure it
- **Full audit trail** — Every agent action logged for research and accountability

The goal: give team leads visibility into organizational risk so they can act before knowledge walks out the door.

## Research Outputs

FRAMES generates valuable research artifacts:

- **Collaboration Datasets** — Anonymized patterns of team interaction
- **Learning Analytics** — Module completion, hint usage, assessment results
- **Process Documentation** — How teams actually work (vs. how they plan to work)
- **Longitudinal Studies** — Knowledge transfer across semesters and cohorts
