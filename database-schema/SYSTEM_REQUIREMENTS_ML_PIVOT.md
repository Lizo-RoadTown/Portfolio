# System Goal: ML-Based Module Generation

**Canon Status:** Active

## 1. Foundation

The FRAMES system is grounded in Herbert Simon's theory of bounded rationality and the observation of real engineering work. Modules are not invented—they are extracted from authentic human learning experiences.

The same principle applies to module *generation*: the best modules will come not from general-purpose language models, but from a system that has learned what actually works for learners in this specific domain.

We have data from real engineering teams and student learning that will inform this model. The system learns from what we observe, not from what we assume.

---

## 2. Vision

**FRAMES will develop a specialized Machine Learning model that learns to generate effective educational modules by observing what helps students succeed.**

This model will:
- Learn from real student outcomes (completion, comprehension, engagement)
- Improve over time as more learning data becomes available
- Be specific to aerospace engineering education
- Produce modules that are measurably more effective than generic LLM output

---

## 3. The Trajectory

**Now:** AI agents build the FRAMES platform. They build it *knowing* that an ML model is the destination—the system they create must support data collection, feedback loops, and continuous improvement.

**Transition:** As the ML model matures, agents shift from primary builders to support roles. The system they built enables their own evolution.

**End State:** The ML model generates and improves modules. Agents support the model—curating data, validating outputs, maintaining quality. The purpose is always student learning.

---

## 4. Desired Outcome

We will know we have succeeded when:
- The ML model generates modules that students complete at higher rates
- Module quality improves automatically as more students use the system
- We are no longer dependent on external LLM APIs for module creation
- The system learns what explanations, structures, and difficulties work best
- Agents have transitioned to supporting roles that enhance the ML model's effectiveness

---

## 5. Implication for Agents

Agents build the system with this trajectory in mind. Their current work creates the foundation for:
- The data the ML model will learn from
- The infrastructure that will support model training
- The feedback systems that enable continuous improvement
- Their own future roles as model support

**How** to achieve this is determined through planning and coordination, not prescribed here.

## 6. Relationship to Other Canon

This goal extends the vision in `RESEARCHER_PLATFORM.md` (analytics and ML) and supports the mission defined in `system_overview_v_2.md` (delivering learning experiences that improve over time).
