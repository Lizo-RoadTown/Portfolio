FRAMES provides program administrators with **predictive capacity, onboarding support, team lead workload reduction, and comprehensive knowledge management** for complex engineering programs.

## The Problem

University engineering programs with NASA contracts face predictable structural failures:

- **Knowledge loss** — Expertise graduates before projects finish
- **Overwhelmed team leads** — Technical work competes with training and documentation
- **Invisible degradation** — Interface failures aren't visible until missions fail
- **Steep learning curves** — New members take too long to become productive

These failures aren't random—they're structural, measurable, and therefore predictable.

## What FRAMES Provides

### 1. Predictive Capacity

The [Predictive Model](/Portfolio/predictive-model/) identifies vulnerabilities before they cause failure:

- **Interface fragility** — Which team connections will break under stress
- **Knowledge concentration** — Single points of failure (people whose departure would be catastrophic)
- **Transition risk** — What breaks when key people leave
- **Subsystem isolation** — Which teams aren't communicating enough

**Workflow:** Measure structure → Predict risks → Design interventions

### 2. Onboarding & Learning Support

The [Onboarding System](/Portfolio/onboarding/) reduces time-to-productivity:

- **Adaptive learning paths** personalized to each learner's background
- **Scaffolded skill building** from foundations to project-specific knowledge
- **Just-in-time support** when learners need it
- **Competency validation** before advancing

Result: Team leads focus on project context instead of answering the same foundational questions repeatedly.

### 3. Team Lead Workload Reduction

[Team Lead Tools](/Portfolio/team-tools/) reduce burden on your most valuable people:

- **Knowledge capture** — Extract documentation from existing activities (no extra work)
- **Handoff management** — Automated checklists, gap detection, verification
- **Decision context** — Document why, not just what
- **Risk visibility** — See knowledge concentration and upcoming departures before they hit

Without FRAMES: training competes with technical work, documentation falls behind, knowledge walks out the door.
With FRAMES: system handles foundational work, agents draft documentation, handoffs are verified.

### 4. AI-Assisted Knowledge Management

[AI Agents](/Portfolio/agents/) reduce administrative burden with human oversight:

- **Alpha agents** — Read-only observation, pattern recognition, reporting
- **Beta agents** — Draft documentation and flag risks (humans approve)
- **Gamma agents** — Execute approved actions (audit logged)

**Agents learn and analyze autonomously, but can't make actual changes without human approval.**

Example: Agents notice undocumented procedure in meeting notes → collaborate to draft SOP → learn from past approvals to improve quality → human reviews before publication.

## Key Capabilities

**Dashboard Metrics:**

- Knowledge concentration (who holds critical expertise)
- Interface health (which team connections are strong vs. degrading)
- Handoff status (are transitions being managed)
- Documentation coverage (what's captured vs. at risk)

**Interface Categories:**
FRAMES tracks three failure points: concurrent (coordination between parallel teams), external (connections to institutions), and intergenerational (cohort handoffs—the most fragile).

**Diagnostic Dimensions:**
Six assessment dimensions including actor autonomy, partitioned knowledge, temporal misalignment, integration cost, and coupling degradation.
