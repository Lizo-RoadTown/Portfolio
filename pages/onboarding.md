Emergent technology teams face steep learning curves. New members join mid-project, receiving information they can't immediately act on. FRAMES provides structured onboarding support that adapts to individual learners.

## The Problem

University teams face unique onboarding challenges:

- **Mid-project entry** — New members join during active development
- **Implicit knowledge** — Procedures exist in heads, not documentation
- **Uneven preparation** — Different skill levels and backgrounds
- **Time pressure** — Technical work takes priority over training
- **Rolling cohorts** — Trainers are often leaving themselves

Result: slow productivity ramp-up, preventable mistakes, overwhelmed team leads.

## How FRAMES Helps

**Adaptive Learning Paths:**
Assess prior experience → identify gaps → personalized modules → scaffolded content → competency validation → integration with real work.

**Scaffolded Skill Building:**

1. Foundational concepts (core knowledge)
2. Role-specific skills
3. Project context (current mission status, decisions, rationale)
4. Hands-on application

**Just-in-Time Support:**
Graduated hint pathways, contextual help when working on tasks, validation steps to catch misunderstandings early.

## Impact

**Before FRAMES:** Team leads personally train each member, knowledge transfer competes with technical work, training quality varies.

**With FRAMES:** System handles foundational training, team leads focus on project context, consistent quality.

**Metrics tracked:** Time to productivity, competency gaps, training completion, mentor utilization.

**Pedagogical foundation:** Built on OATutor—scaffolding, hint pathways, validation, spaced practice.
