## The Research Question

> **Can we predict mission success or failure based on organizational structure?**

University CubeSat programs are the ideal research environment. 88% fail to persist long enough to achieve mission success (Pham, 2024)—not due to student capability, but because they operate in boundary spaces where institutional classifications, funding, and embedded support are unclear or absent.

---

## Theoretical Framework

### Nearly Decomposable Architecture (NDA)

FRAMES operationalizes Simon's (1962) nearly decomposable systems theory:

- **Modules** — Strong internal bonds (like atoms in molecules)
- **Interfaces** — Weaker connections between modules
- **Interface Mechanisms** — Roles, processes, and tools that maintain connections

Key insight: Modules can adapt internally without destabilizing the system, but weaker external bonds erode if not maintained. When interfaces fail, systems fragment.

### Hybrid Autonomous Organizations (HAOs)

Student space labs exemplify HAOs (Champenois & Etzkowitz, 2018)—operating outside traditional academic hierarchies, integrating functions typically distributed across universities, government, and industry. Their lack of formal classification creates vulnerability: they must navigate misaligned institutional logics while maintaining tenuous external connections.

---

## Six Diagnostic Dimensions

FRAMES assesses interfaces using six NDA diagnostic dimensions:

| Dimension | Research Question |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Actor Autonomy** | How independently do interdependent actors operate? Are objectives conflicting? |
| **Partitioned Knowledge** | Is knowledge siloed? What integration mechanisms exist? |
| **Emergent Outputs** | How often do goals shift or remain undefined during development? |
| **Temporal Misalignment** | Do timelines differ across modules (academic calendars vs. project cycles)? |
| **Integration Cost** | Is coordination effort sustainable at each interface? |
| **Coupling Degradation** | Are planned interfaces still occurring? Are modules disengaging? |

---

## Interface Categories

Three interface types with distinct failure patterns:

- **Concurrent** — Between active modules working in parallel
- **External** — Connecting to outside institutional modules
- **Intergenerational** — Linking outgoing and incoming cohorts

---

## Knowledge Types at Interfaces

Two primary knowledge-transfer types exist at interfaces, each with different fragility patterns:

| Knowledge Type | Description | Transfer Mechanism | Fragility |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Codified** | Documented, transferable independent of individuals | Walkthroughs, documentation repositories, design reviews | More resilient |
| **Institutional** | Tacit, experience-based, held by individuals | In-person experience, repetition, mentorship | Prone to degradation |

Interfaces dominated by institutional knowledge are more prone to degradation when personnel rotate out.

---

## Rotational Micro-Modules

University space labs contain overlapping, rotational micro-modules—student cohorts cycling in and out over 1-4 semesters. This creates predictable knowledge-transfer vulnerabilities:

- Incoming cohorts join mid-project, receiving information they cannot immediately act on
- Middle cohorts pass along knowledge tied only to their current project phase
- Outgoing cohorts graduate before projects complete, leaving incomplete work and undocumented context

---

## What the Model Predicts

| Risk Factor | Prediction |
|-------------|------------|
| **Interface fragility** | Which connections between subsystems will fail under stress |
| **Knowledge concentration** | Single points of failure where expertise is too centralized |
| **Transition risk** | What breaks when key people leave |
| **Subsystem isolation** | Which teams aren't communicating enough |
| **Mission success probability** | Overall likelihood given current structure |

---

## Broader Implications

If the model works here, it applies directly to:

- NASA centers and commercial space programs
- Startup engineering teams
- R&D laboratories
- Any organization undertaking complex emergent technology missions

---

## Research Outputs

### Data Collection

FRAMES instruments team activities across multiple touchpoints:

- Notion workspaces (documentation, decisions, handoffs)
- GitHub repositories (code, issues, collaboration patterns)
- Structured assessments (knowledge checks, competency validation)
- Manual observation protocols

### Analysis Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Interface Mapping** | Visualize all connections between modules |
| **Bond Strength Metrics** | Quantify coupling strength at each interface |
| **Knowledge Distribution** | Track where expertise lives across the organization |
| **Failure Tracing** | Backward-trace failures to interface breakdowns |
| **Temporal Analysis** | Study how interfaces degrade over cohort rotations |

### Research Platform

The Researcher Platform provides:

- **Jupyter Notebooks** — Direct access to research datasets
- **MLflow** — Experiment tracking for predictive models
- **Superset** — Visualization dashboards for pattern discovery

## Why University Space Labs?

| Property | Research Value |
|----------|----------------|
| **NASA contracts** | Real deliverables, real deadlines, real consequences |
| **Visible interfaces** | Small teams make every connection observable |
| **Clear outcomes** | Missions succeed or fail; no ambiguity |
| **Student rotation** | Natural experiments in knowledge loss |
| **Multi-institution** | Cross-validate across different contexts |

These aren't classroom projects—they're NASA-contracted missions with actual deliverables. The combination of real stakes and observable structure makes university space labs uniquely valuable for organizational research.
