**FRAMES predicts mission success for emergent technology projects by mapping organizational structure.**

Emergent technology—where requirements evolve during development and solutions aren't predetermined—resists traditional prediction methods. University space programs provide high-stakes, real-world environments ideal for both training predictive models and applying them to improve program outcomes: NASA-contracted missions with observable team structures, documented outcomes, and controlled knowledge-transfer challenges from student rotation.

By measuring organizational structure in these environments, FRAMES develops models that serve dual purposes: advancing predictive methods for emergent technology research, and providing program administrators with actionable tools for managing mission-critical projects.

## What the Model Does

FRAMES maps team structure—who knows what, how teams connect, where knowledge concentrates—and identifies vulnerabilities before they cause mission failure.

---

## Theoretical Foundation

FRAMES builds on Herbert Simon's research on nearly decomposable systems (1962). Think of it like molecular chemistry:

- **Modules** = strong internal bonds (like atoms in a molecule)
- **Interfaces** = weaker connections between modules (like molecular bonds)
- **Interface Mechanisms** = the roles, processes, and tools that maintain these connections

The insight: modules can adapt internally without destabilizing the whole system, but weaker external bonds erode if not maintained. When interfaces fail, teams fragment.

## What the Model Predicts

| Risk Factor | What It Reveals |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Interface fragility** | Which connections between subsystems will fail under stress |
| **Knowledge concentration** | Single points of failure where expertise is too centralized |
| **Transition risk** | What breaks when key people leave |
| **Subsystem isolation** | Which teams aren't communicating enough |
| **Mission success probability** | Overall likelihood given current structure |

---

## Three Types of Failure Points

| Interface Type | What It Is | Primary Risk |
|----------------|------------|--------------|
| **Concurrent** | Active teams working in parallel | Coordination breakdown |
| **External** | Connections to outside institutions | Misaligned support |
| **Intergenerational** | Handoffs between student cohorts | Knowledge loss (most critical) |

---

## Six Diagnostic Dimensions

FRAMES assesses interfaces using six NDA diagnostic dimensions:

| Dimension | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| **Actor Autonomy** | How independently do interdependent actors operate? Are objectives conflicting? |
| **Partitioned Knowledge** | Is knowledge siloed? What integration mechanisms exist? |
| **Emergent Outputs** | How often do goals shift or remain undefined during development? |
| **Temporal Misalignment** | Do timelines differ across modules (academic calendars vs. project cycles)? |
| **Integration Cost** | Is coordination effort sustainable at each interface? |
| **Coupling Degradation** | Are planned interfaces still occurring? Are modules disengaging? |

---

## Knowledge Types

Two primary knowledge-transfer types exist at interfaces, each with different fragility patterns:

| Knowledge Type | Description | Transfer Mechanism | Fragility |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Codified** | Documented, transferable independent of individuals | Walkthroughs, documentation, design reviews | More resilient |
| **Institutional** | Tacit, experience-based, held by individuals | Mentorship, overlap periods, repetition | Prone to degradation |

Interfaces dominated by institutional knowledge are more prone to degradation when personnel rotate out.

---

## Why Student Teams Are Predictably Fragile

University teams have overlapping student cohorts that rotate every 1-4 semesters, creating predictable failure patterns:

- **Incoming members** join mid-project, receiving information they can't act on yet
- **Middle cohorts** only know their project phase, not the full arc
- **Graduating members** leave before projects complete, taking undocumented context with them

These aren't random failures—they're structural, and therefore measurable.

## Applications

**For Program Administrators:**
Identify single points of failure before people leave, see which interfaces are degrading, predict knowledge crises.

**For Researchers:**
Instrumented teams as natural experiments, validated predictive models, interface-outcome correlations.

## Broader Impact

If this works for university space labs, it applies to NASA centers, commercial space companies, startup engineering teams, and any organization building complex emergent technology with rotating personnel.
